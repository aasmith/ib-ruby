== Overview

This provides a Ruby interface to the Interactive Brokers' Trader
Workstation API (http://www.interactivebrokers.com/). This code is not
sanctioned or endorsed by IB.

== Status of this release 

This is an alpha test quality release. I specifically DO NOT recommend
that it be used for live trading under any circumstances. It has not
been tested. I am releasing it in the hopes that the many eyes of the
community will help with enhancing it, so that we all will have a
robust and reliable library to use.



== Use
First, start up TWS and set it to allow connections from localhost.

Then:

   require 'ib'

   ib = IB::IB.new()

You should see messages flash by displaying the startup messages
received from TWS.
